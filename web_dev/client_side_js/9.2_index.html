			<p>Present belly, scratch hand when stroked poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the <a href="javascript:;">soapy mopping</a> up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls. Cat not kitten around claws in your leg and loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it or with tail in the air missing until dinner time, yet sit and stare playing with balls of wool. Run in circles chew foot meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing meow to be let in but kick up litter. My left donut is missing, as is my right claw drapes, so pose purrfectly to show my beauty.</p>
